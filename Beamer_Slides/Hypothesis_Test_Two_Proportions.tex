\begin{frame}{Second Verse Same(?) as the First}
In this section we will be testing the differences between two proportions, much like we did with testing two means. \newline\\	\pause

Much of the material will be the two-sample version of hypothesis testing of a single proportion.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Test Statistic and $p$-Value}
The test statistic for two sample proportions is given by
\[
t = \frac{(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) - (p_1 - p_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}}
\]
where 	\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\hat{p}_1 \text{ and } \hat{p}_2$ represent the sample proportions	\pause
	\item $p_1 \text{ and } p_2$ represent the population proportions	\pause
	\item $n_1 \text{ and } n_2$ represent the sample sizes	\pause
\end{itemize}

The $p$-value is found in the same manner as other sections.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Confidence Intervals}
The $1-\alpha$ confidence interval is calculated as
\[
(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}
\]	\pause
Remember, if our confidence interval contains the claimed difference in population proportions, we do not reject the null hypothesis.

\begin{frame}{Example 1}
A poll of 450 registered voters is taken and 43\% of them would vote for the incumbent candidate. A week later a poll of 300 registered voters is taken and 41\% of them would vote for the incumbent candidate. \newline\\

At the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level, test the claim that the proportions of all registered voters would vote for the incumbent candidate.	\newline\\	\pause

$H_0: \, p_1 = p_2$ \newline	\pause
$H_A: \, p_1 \neq p_2$
